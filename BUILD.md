# Building ModelBox 

This guide is intended for users installing Modelbox and developers who wish to contribute to the project to build modelbox from source.

## Build using the go toolchain

```
go build -o build/modelbox ./cmd/modelbox
````

## Build using goreleaser for development
```
goreleaser build --single-target --snapshot
```

## Build using goreleaser for all supported platforms

This is the preferred way to build ModelBox as it creates binaries for all the versions we support -

Install goreleaser first - https://goreleaser.com/install/

Once gorealeaser is installed, run the following command -
```
goreleaser build --snapshot --rm-dist
```

## Building a Docker Container to serve ModelBox server locally
This will build the modelbox server binary from source and create a Docker container to run the server. This is only possible if goreleaser is invoked in the realease mode.
```
goreleaser release --snapshot --rm-dist
```

This creates the following docker images -
```
(base) diptanuc@firefly:~/Projects/modelbox$ docker images
REPOSITORY                 TAG                  IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
diptanu/modelbox           0.0.1-next-amd64     893ae15a50b7   2 minutes ago   14.9MB
diptanu/modelbox           0.0.1-next-arm64v8   67ff73eb4604   2 minutes ago   14.4MB
```

The Docker image has a copy of the configuration which is generated by `modelbox server init-config` so it stores metadata in ephemeral storage and uses in-memory storage for metrics. For real usage in production, the config should be modified and bind-mounted into the container at `/app/modelbox.toml`
